            Increasing prosperity in our lives can be accomplished by having
            the right frame of mind. The truth is, our thoughts are very
            powerful.
          </p><br />
          <div class="hidden" id="hidden">
            <p>
              They are capable of influencing every aspect of our daily lives,
              from our physical health to our social behaviors. I’m sure
              you’ve heard the adage, “As you think, so shall you be.”
            </p><br />
            <p>
              If we want to improve our lives, we must first improve our
              thoughts. Harnessing the power of thought in a positive way has
              the ability to create great change in our lives, including our
              financial well-being and prosperity. But how? How do we take
              something as intangible as thoughts, and manifest them into a
              physical reality?
            </p><br />
            <p>
              We must first understand that being prosperous is more than
              having a lot of money. Prosperity is a mindset, a way of
              interacting in our lives, and a way of thinking. Mastering this
              train of thought is not easy, but it is simple enough if we keep
              working on it consistently.
            </p><br />
            <p>
              Following are some ideas to help you improve your thoughts, and
              ultimately attract more prosperity into your life:
            </p><br />
            <p>
              Be grateful for the blessings in your life right now. Take a few
              minutes each day to express heartfelt gratitude for the good
              things in your life. Even more powerful, write a few of these
              blessings down each day. This helps to put your focus in the
              right direction — on abundance, not lack.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Use positive affirmations to begin training yourself to think
              positively. Use “I am” statements such as “I am worthy of all
              that is good.” Write the statements down and repeat them nightly
              before bed. Over time, this will implant these thoughts into
              your subconscious mind, and you will begin to naturally believe
              them.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Creative visualization can help you achieve prosperity by
              determining what it is you wish to achieve, and then thoroughly
              creating that image in your mind. This works in the same way
              affirmations do. Our subconscious will fill with images of
              prosperity, and eventually these subconscious “truths” will
              manifest in the physical. “See” yourself as being prosperous,
              and you will become so.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Encourage yourself with the belief that you can achieve great
              things. This could also be one of your affirmations, but expand
              on it. If you know you can earn a certain salary, tell yourself
              you can earn more. Allow yourself to believe all things are
              possible, and you will gain the confidence needed to reach
              higher than you ever imagined you could. If you believe you can
              do it, you are more likely to take the risks associated with
              people who are highly successful. Prosperity and success go hand
              in hand, so take risks and aim higher.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Start a savings account. As strange as it sounds, think about
              this: Like Attracts Like. Even if you can only afford to put a
              few dollars into your account every month, it will begin to
              build up and attract more money.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Finally, believe you are already wealthy. The creative ability
              of our thoughts is such that we lend more power and energy to
              whatever we consistently focus on. Focusing on lack will create
              more lack. Focusing on wealth and prosperity will create . . .
              guess what?
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Remember that this is a process. You likely won’t change your
              circumstances in one day. But over time, with consistent focus,
              your thoughts will begin to attract what you want. Once you
              master this power of thought, there are truly no limits to what
              you can create!

            Successful businesses have many things in common, today we’ll look
            at the big ‘R’ of recognition and how a digital advertising
            network may help.
          </p><br />
          <div class="hidden-rtl" id="hidden-rtl">
            <p>
              Recognition can be illustrated by two individuals entering a
              crowded room at a party. Both walk to the far side of the room,
              one of them slips through the crowd easily and unnoticed as they
              reach the far side. The second person takes much longer to reach
              the far side because they are engaged in conversations along the
              way as they continue to meet acquaintances and friends during
              their path. Which type of person would you like to model your
              business after?
            </p> <br />
            <p>
              Your business is in a continual battle for your customers’
              recognition whether you know it or not. If you happen to be
              fortunate enough to be in a marketplace with very few
              competitors, that will not last for long. You need your business
              to be at the forefront of your client’s minds so that when they
              require your products or services, you are the go-to people.
            </p><br />
            <p>
              Marketing your business is a necessity. Putting your name and
              logo out there and keeping it there is a must. This lets clients
              know that you are “still around” and in business. Frequency is a
              good way to achieve the “stand out factor” in recognition. I am
              reminded of both television and radio ads I had heard of in the
              past. They run continually with a catch phrase or musical jingle
              over and over again on the radio or television until you are
              absolutely sick of hearing it. You also cannot get it out of
              your head. Although this type of advertising is expensive, it
              can be very effective, and the recognition factor is quite high.
              Television and radio can reach a large audience, and they are
              broad in their appeal. In a brief sentence, you are paying to
              market to both those that are your potential customers and a
              large segment of those who are not now and probably never will
              be your customers.
            </p><br />
            <p>
              There are more economical ways to pursue frequency, the point is
              to define your target market demographic, and invest your
              marketing funds into the locations that will best be seen by
              them.
            </p><br />
            <p>
              Another factor to consider is “can I market myself in a place
              where I will stand out from my competition, or where my
              competition does not have a presence?” Why would you market
              yourself in a flyer or newspaper right beside your competition
              and risk blending into a crowd, and ultimately being ignored?
              Another issue to look at is diversification. As the saying goes,
              “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”. When you look at your
              advertising budget for the year, try to find the affordable
              solutions that will continue to reap during the full year of
              your advertising budget. An expensive radio or television
              promotion may give short term gains for that weekend sale, but
              what about the rest of the year? Your clients may end up with
              the impression of where did they go, I haven’t seen or heard
              anything about them for so long.
            </p><br />
            <p>
              Don’t always look for the old standbys in marketing, but keep
              your eyes and ears open for the latest and greatest ways to
              market your business. With the costs of technology coming down
              dramatically new options such as digital advertising on LCD and
              Plasma screens are becoming more and more affordable, and the
              paper billboards and posters becoming a thing of the past. With
              the flexibility, and curb appeal of full color and motion video
              footage with computer generated graphics available to you, this
              is an option you don’t want to pass by without a good look.
              Ultimately, recognition is required if you want to get people
              “in the door” of your business (or on your website for the new
              e-businesses). This is going to cost you money, time and effort
              up front any way that you look at it, but if you have
              successfully reached your target market, the payoffs will be
              worth it.
